            <li>spicy broccoli</li>
            <li>tomatoes</li>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 425. Toss chicken breasts with olive oil and umami seasoning. Transfer to a lined baking sheet and cook in the oven for 20 minutes, until the chicken reaches 165 degrees.</li>
            <li>Slice the chicken into bite sized cubes.</li>
            <li>Toss the broccoli with olive oil, umami seasoning, and red pepper flakes. Transfer to a lined baking sheet and cook in the oven for 15 minutes. I recommend cooking the broccoli at the same time as the chicken to save time.</li>
            <li>Add water to a pot over medium heat. When the water is boiling, add quinoa. Cover, turn heat to low, and cook for 15-20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Wash the cherry tomatoes and cut in half.</li>
            <li>Add the slice of bread to a food processor and pulse until small breadcrumbs remain. Transfer the breadcrumbs to a small pan over medium heat. Add olive oil and za'atar. Stir continually and cook until the breadcrumbs are toasted.</li>
            <li>Add basil, olive oil, apple cider vinegar, umami seasoning, and garlic to a food processor. Blend until smooth.</li>
            <li>To assemble the salad, add the spinach and quinoa to a large bowl. Add the vinaigrette and toss to combine. Divide the greens between two bowls. Top each with roasted chicken, cherry tomatoes, roasted broccoli, parmesan, and za'atar breadcrumbs. Enjoy!</li>
